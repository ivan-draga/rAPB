Starting from this address, there are hundreds (if not thousand) of functions listed in here, and all are somehow tied to district server AFAIK. This address also contains all ~10 district packets that are only ones referenced in the game executable. This could be the 'holy' function of the whole district server.


0x109B15D0
This one is called after each of the upper mentioned function. Yes, after each! Unknown purpose for now...


0x11804E4C & 0x11804DB7
These two both contain a string that says "Character %s has entered the district". (%s=character name)

A string is present here that says "Xtea decrypt time". Interesting is, that Xtea is used in Unreal Engine to encrypt messages, and possibly packes. But the only thing that bothers me is that it is only mentioned once in the whole game code (maybe matters, maybe doesn't). Click here! The actual encryption (if it's not this one) has yet to be discovered, but in an hour research I found out a lot of stuff. Even if I don't get the encryption, I could still do some patches to bypass it and have the raw packets for the emulator. Nevertheless, not promising anything to anyone yet...

--

Now, unrelated to game addresses, but still cool research info. Apart from login/loby, world and district servers, there are also following servers that are/were present in the game:

Music - looks up song name and artist, returns the info
Image - for custom created symbols and displaying on display points, since those are threated as normal image files
Chat* - handles the chatting in whatever chat?
Clan* - handles the clans and their managment?
Display Point* - handles all the display points over all districts?
Group*  - handles all the groups?
Mission - gives the missions?
Mail* - stores users mails?
Marketplace* - handles all those items on sale?
Name Filter* - checks if name is alright by it's rules?

* - not sure about the actual purpose of those, neither I know why are they here since pretty much all of their functionalities is performed by the world server solely. And don't let those question marks confuse you, those are only assumptions of mine, seems like that those server don't have actual purpose, but are still present in the game exectuable.

Seems like the client uses some kind of HTTP 'pinging' to district server, thus the bold part is some kind of placeholder showing how the server should react back. Example: "Name=Player" means that a playing character is connecting, while "team=255" probably means the faction of that connecting character is not yet defined, thus being 255 (which is 2^6-1) means a placeholder until the character successfully connects. Needless to say, that bold line seems not to occur in G1's APB in this form, though it appears spread in few lines rather than in single line, meaning it's still there, but changed

Here 'Xtea' reference appears even in game log, possibly meaning the districts actually use the XTEA encryption.

A source code for XTEA encryption/decryption in C# can be found in this repository folder.

This occurs when client successfully connects to server and then the real entering beggins. Those 'Handshakes' seem crucial parts of district connecting/entering. After that, seems like certain game packages get 'identified' by server (ranging from vehicles to weapons to symbols). Example:

And the list goes on and on and on... until eventually client enters the district. Seems like that GUID is probably a CRC32 hash (look at the part of this post where 'Xtea' log reference is mentioned, you will also see a bolded CRC reference). This happens at some point of district entering:
